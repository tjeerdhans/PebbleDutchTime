Pebble Dutch Time
=================

Forked from MaikJoosten/DutchFuzzyTimeSource

Renamed to Pebble Dutch Time.

Added optional use of 'twintig', so time can be displayed as 'twintig voor tien' instead of 'tien over half tien'. 

Currently working on integration with setpebble.com, so this 'twintig' option can be switched on or off.
