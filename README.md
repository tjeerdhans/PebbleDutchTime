Pebble Dutch Time
=================

This is a Pebble Watchface that displays the approximate time in Dutch.

Forked from MaikJoosten/DutchFuzzyTimeSource, refactored and renamed to 'Dutch time'. Many thanks for his excellent starting point!

Added optional use of 'twintig', so time can be displayed as 'twintig voor tien' instead of 'tien over half tien'. 
It's integrated with setpebble.com, so this 'twintig' option can be switched on or off.
